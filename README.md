## Photoluminescence scanner
 Thesis Project in collaboration with DTU Electro

Project software located in _/Software_ folder, along with calibration files. Note that the .raw calibration files are stored on Git LFS and has a monthly bandwidth limit (1GB). Only needed for re-calibration, otherwise K, P and DIM files are enough for the program to run - so download only these unless absolutely necessary.

Project mechanical data located in _/Mechanical_ includes .STL files for all 3D printed components for the system, along with .step files for the entire system assembly for reference.

Data for the custom PCBs used in IR LED driving located in _/PCB_.

Please download the proprietary First Light Imaging (FLI) API before use and add to the work folder to use the main script "_PLRobot.py_".
This can be found on their website https://andor.oxinst.com/downloads/view/first-light-imaging-sdk-installer but requires user login.
